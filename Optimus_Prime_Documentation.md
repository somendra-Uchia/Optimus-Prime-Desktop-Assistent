## Architecture & Control Flow

### Main Entry Point: `Optimus.py`
The system starts from `Optimus.py`, which serves as the main orchestrator:

```python
# Main control flow:
1. Check internet connectivity
2. Initialize greeting (online/offline dialogue)
3. Start daemon threads for background services:
   - Battery monitoring
   - Schedule checking
   - Main assistant brain (co_brain.py)
   - Alarm monitoring
4. Maintain main thread alive for graceful shutdown
```

### Control Flow Diagram:
